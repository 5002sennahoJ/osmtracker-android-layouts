Walk Ride Detailed
============

This layout is intended for users updating in detail paths, tracks, cycleways and other routes which are normally travelled on foot, wheelchair, horse or cycle. All of these may take the form of a designated public right of way, a permissive route, or a private / customer only route.  

Hopefully with the aid of this layout you will be able to survey the route and gain enough information in the form of geo-referenced notes, recordings and photographs to allow you to update OpenStreetMap to a high standard.  

Button sets or pages  
--------------------

The button sets should assist you with surveying such features as a 'track' which is used by farm vehicles, but is also a Public Right of Way, designated as a **footpath**.  
Button sets include;  

*  LOOKS LIKE - allows you to chose what the feature looks like, such as a track.  
*  DESIGNATION - if signed, allows you to note the designation displayed.
